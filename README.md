## Raytracer
(In progress)

### Purpose
In this project I aim to build a basic raytracer by following various online sources and information, chiefly this PDF by Peter Shirley: https://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracing/Ray%20Tracing%20in%20a%20Weekend.pdf

For now, the code implements a vec3 and ray class, and uses it to render positionally colored images stored in PPM format. Spheres and materials to come.
